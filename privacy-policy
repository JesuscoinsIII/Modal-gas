# MODAL MEMBER AGREEMENT & TERMS OF SERVICE

This User Agreement (the “Agreement”) together with all attached schedules and the MODAL Booking Rules which are incorporated by reference as if restated in full herein, and as such Rules are amended from time to time (the “Rules”), represents the total agreement by and between Modal Booking, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MODAL”) and the user of the Modal services (the “User”), and is effective as of the date Services are booked or actually used, whichever is earlier (the “Effective Date”). Each of the above is a “party” and, collectively, all are the “parties”.

In addition, third party carriers and facility, event and equipment operators (each a “PROVIDER”) may prescribe its own rules for use of the PROVIDER (“PROVIDER Rules”). In the event of a dispute between the PROVIDER Rules and the Rules, the PROVIDER Rules shall prevail. In the event of a dispute between the PROVIDER Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. In the event of a dispute between the Rules and this Agreement, the Rules shall prevail.

If the signatory of this Agreement is a group, association or legal entity (the “Entity User”), for purposes of this Agreement, “User” and “User” shall mean the Entity User and Staff (defined below), unless specified otherwise.

## Description of Services

With this Agreement, User agrees to become a User of the nation-wide MODAL network, and MODAL admits such User as a User. In addition, pursuant to this Agreement, MODAL will schedule and contract for PROVIDER to provide User certain services, such as access to various PROVIDER transportation services, facilities, equipment and/or events.

User acknowledges that User are participating in or using the Services at User’s own free will and decision, and that MODAL has no any liability with respect to: 
- User’s access, participation or use of the Services (or lack thereof);
- Any loss of data, information, or privacy resulting from such participation or use;
- Any damage, theft or loss of User’s equipment, personal effects, or any other property; or
- Any injury to User.

MODAL IS A SCHEDULER AND RESELLER ONLY, AND NOT A PROVIDER OF TRANSPORTATION, EQUIPMENT, EVENT, OR FACILITY SERVICES.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES

MODAL and all PROVIDERS are independent contractors and not partners or joint venturers. MODAL is not affiliated with any PROVIDER.

## SERVICE FEE

In consideration for access to the Services, the PROVIDER, and membership in MODAL, User agrees to pay the Service Fee listed in the Signature Block below (the “Service Fee”) to MODAL. User is not to ever pay any Start-Up Fee, Service Fee, or any other fees to PROVIDER, directly (except for Ancillary Services fees, as described below). PROVIDER agrees that any such Service Fees or other fees paid to PROVIDER by User are to held by PROVIDER solely for and on behalf of MODAL, and will be paid to MODAL within three (3) days or receipt of same by PROVIDER.

## ANCILLARY SERVICES CHARGES

User may incur additional charges related to the Services for certain special privileges or services not included in the User’s membership (“Ancillary Services”). Ancillary Services include add-on services of PROVIDER that are used by User, from time to time. Ancillary Services do not include fees related to use of PROVIDER, PROVIDER equipment, or other fees and costs which should reasonably be included in the Service Fee.

Unless payment for such Ancillary Services is made at the time the additional service is used, PROVIDER will invoice the User for such Additional Service along with the monthly invoice for the Service Fee directly to User, and User will pay such Ancillary Services fees directly to PROVIDER, and not to MODAL. Nevertheless, PROVIDER will send a copy of all invoices related to Ancillary Services to MODAL at the same time the invoice is sent to User so.

## PAYMENT

All payments will be made by:
1. Automatic debit from User’s checking account, or
2. Via credit card automatic payment.

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, User will provide User’s credit card or bank account (the “Account”) information to MODAL for the payment of Service Fees. MODAL will debit or charge User’s Account on or about the first day of each calendar month for that month’s Service Fee (e.g., MODAL will charge Account on January 1 for January’s Service Fee).

User further agrees to pay all credit card invoices in accordance with their credit card agreements, and not to challenge or otherwise oppose MODAL charges against such card. In the event an Account is canceled or a credit card expires, User must ensure alternate payment account information is provided to MODAL at least 72 hours before the date of Services to avoid termination of User’s membership and Services.

Interest on any unpaid or underpaid Payments for Service Fees or any other fees or amounts owed to MODAL, begins to accrue on the first day after the due date of such payment, and shall be charged at 10% APR, compounded daily, or at the highest legal rate of interest allowed, whichever is less.

In the event payment is refused for any reason, MODAL will contact User via email and/or phone. Failure to resolve the Account issue or provide alternative/new account information and make payment within three (3) days after MODAL contacts User will result in immediate suspension of all Services PROVIDER access, and User privileges, and MODAL may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate this Agreement for breach by User.

User is solely responsible for any fees or charges resulting from issues related to the Account and/or from User’s breach of this Agreement, including (without limitation) all bank fees, interest fees, legal expenses and other similar expenses.

MODAL will not pay refunds to User under any circumstances except in the instance of a clear error by MODAL or MODAL’ bank (e.g., Account is improperly debited twice, incorrect amount is charged, etc.) The entire Service Fee for the month is due on the first of the month, so no full or partial refund will be paid to User, even of the membership is terminated during the month.

## MODAL IP

“MODAL” and all MODAL trademarks, designs, brands, names, domain names, web sites, articles, posts, designs, programs and slogans, program materials and other copyrighted works, confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets, methods and industrial designs, and all other intellectual property used by or at MODAL (collectively the “MODAL IP”) are the exclusive property of MODAL and its licensors. Users and PROVIDER are granted a revocable license to use MODAL IP in connection with the Services, subject to these Rules and any and all other rules, policies and requirements of MODAL. No other use, copying, or creation of derivative works is permitted absent prior written consent from MODAL.

## TICKETS/Keys/Keycards

Tickets or other evidence issued by MODAL or a PROVIDER to a User and/or any User guests granting access to Services are non-transferable absent prior approval of MODAL. If User receives a key/keycard or similar access devices to be used in connection with the Services, sharing or loaning out keys/keycards is strictly prohibited, and will result in termination of User Account and/or access to the Services. If lost, the User will pay a fee of $50 to replace the key/keycard.

## ISSUES & INQUIRIES

User will direct all issues and questions related to this Agreement, billing and payment to MODAL, and not to PROVIDER. User will direct all issues and questions related to the Services and/or use of PROVIDER to the PROVIDER, and not to MODAL.

## TERM & TERMINATION

The term shall begin on the Effective Date, and shall continue for the duration of the Services, unless terminated as provided herein (the “Term”). This Agreement may be terminated by MODAL, PROVIDER or User thirty (30) days prior to the Services by written notice to all parties.

User acknowledges that MODAL and PROVIDER each have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately for Cause. Without limiting the above, failure of User to comply with this Agreement “Cause” includes: 
1. The PROVIDER Rules and/or the Rules, and
2. Failure of User to make timely payment of any Service Fees.

In addition to all other fees, costs, expenses due to MODAL under this Agreement, and all other remedies available to PROVIDER and MODAL, under this Agreement, or at law or equity, if this Agreement is terminated for Cause, User will be assessed a Termination Fee of up to 80% of the total Service Fee (“Termination Fee”).

Upon termination, User shall surrender all keys, access cards, and any other PROVIDER and/or MODAL property, and will remove any User property from PROVIDER. Any property not removed by the terminating User shall be deemed abandoned and PROVIDER may destroy or otherwise use or dispose of any and all such property. Neither PROVIDER nor MODAL is responsible for forwarding any User property after the termination date.

Termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not obviate User’s obligation to pay any Service Fees or other charges incurred prior to the date of termination. Moreover, in addition to any other Fees or damages which may be owed to MODAL or PROVIDER by User, at the move-out of an Office User (i.e., a User who uses a private office at PROVIDER), MODAL will charge a move-out fee to cover the patching/painting of walls and for any other repairs to the space, re-keying charges of any keys are not returned, etc. (the ”Move Out Fee”). MODAL will also charge a Move Out Fee to Users
